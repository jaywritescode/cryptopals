# problem 1

### Convert hex to base64

The problem description is incorrect. What it should say is that the hexadecimal _number_ 49276d206b696c6c696e6720796f757220627261696e206c696b65206120706f69736f6e6f7573206d757368726f6f6d converted to base64 should produce the string "SSdtIGtpbGxpbmcgeW91ciBicmFpbiBsaWtlIGEgcG9pc29ub3VzIG11c2hyb29t".

# problem 2

### Fixed XOR

To be fair, this one at least has a description that talks about taking two equal length _buffers_ and xor-ing them.

Still, when it says "string", it means "base-16 number".
